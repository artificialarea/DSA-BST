## 1. Draw a Binary Search Tree (BST)

**1 ]** Given the data `3,1,4,6,9,2,5,7`, if you were to insert this into an empty binary search tree, what would the tree look like? (Draw the tree, no coding needed here.)
```
            [3]                              
           /   \                
        [1]     [4]                 
           \       \                   
            [2]     [6]   
                   /   \                
                [5]     [9]
                       /              
                    [7]
```

**2 ]** Draw the BST with the keys - E A S Y Q U E S T I O N

Presumably would convert the string characters to numerical ASCII 
(Question: should I then create hash value with the hash function `k Mod m`, too?)
